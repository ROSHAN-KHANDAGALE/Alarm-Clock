# Alarm Clock Application

## Overview

The Alarm Clock Application is a graphical user interface (GUI) program designed to help users set and manage alarms. It provides an intuitive interface for setting alarm times, receiving notifications, and handling alarms effectively. The application is built using `Python` and the `tkinter` library, offering a user-friendly experience for managing daily alarms.

## Features

- **Set Alarms:** Users can easily set alarm times using the provided input fields, specifying hours, minutes, and seconds.

- **Real-Time Display:** The application displays the current time in real-time, helping users keep track of their current time relative to their alarm settings.

- **Alarm Notification:** When the set alarm time matches the current time, the application triggers a sound notification to alert the user.

- **Customizable Interface:** The application provides an opportunity to customize the background image, allowing users to personalize their alarm clock experience.

## Advantages

- **User-Friendly:** The application offers a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users of all levels to set and manage alarms.

- **Customization:** Users can set their preferred background image, adding a personal touch to the alarm clock's appearance.

- **Audible Alerts:** The sound notification ensures users do not miss their alarms, even if the application window is not in focus.

- **No Internet Required:** The application is self-contained and does not rely on an internet connection, ensuring alarms work regardless of connectivity.

## Implementation

The Alarm Clock Application is developed in Python using the `tkinter` library for creating the graphical user interface. It utilizes the `PIL` (Pillow) library to handle images, allowing users to set custom background images. The alarm functionality is achieved by comparing the set alarm time with the current time and triggering a sound notification when they match.

To run the application, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries (`tkinter` and `PIL`) installed. Then, execute the provided Python script `alarm_clock.py`. The application will display a window where you can set alarms and receive notifications.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Alarms:** Implement support for setting multiple alarms.

- **Snooze Functionality:** Add a snooze option to delay alarms.

- **Persistent Alarms:** Store alarms even after closing the application.

- **More Sound Options:** Allow users to select different alarm sounds.

- **Responsive UI:** Create a responsive design to adapt to various screen sizes.
